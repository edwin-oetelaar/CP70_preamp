## Project Overview

This repository contains the KiCad project files, documentation, and design decisions for a custom-built 72-channel pre-amplifier designed for a Yamaha CP70 electric grand piano. This project is an open-source initiative developed in collaboration with [Paviljoen Ongehoorde Muziek (POM)](https://www.pomeindhoven.nl/) in Eindhoven, Netherlands, as part of an art project.

The primary goal of this pre-amplifier is to individually buffer and potentially amplify the signals from each of the 72 string pickups of the CP70, providing a high-quality, low-noise output output signal for further amplification to 72 speakers.

## Background

The Yamaha CP70 is an iconic electric grand piano known for its unique sound, derived from real strings and hammers combined with a piezo pickup system.
This project aims to provide a modern, high-fidelity replacement, with 72 separate output channels as an alternative pre-amplifier system.

This pre-amp is designed with the following considerations:
*   **High Input Impedance:** To accurately capture the full tonal character of the CP70 pickups without loading them down.
*   **Low Noise Performance:** Essential for a clean signal, especially with 72 individual channels.
*   **Sufficient Headroom:** To handle the potentially large signal swings from the pickups.
*   **Individual Channel Processing:** Each pickup receives its own pre-amplifier stage.
*   **Modularity:** For ease of assembly, testing, and maintenance.
*   **Open Source:** All design files and documentation are publicly available to encourage learning, modification, accessibility.

## Project Status

[ **TODO: Update this section regularly, e.g., In Design, Prototyping, Tested, In Use** ]

*   Current Version: [e.g., v0.1 - Initial Design]
*   Key Milestones:
    *   [x] Initial schematic design complete.
    *   [x] PCB layout for [16]-channel module complete.
    *   [x] PCB ordered
    *   [x] parts ordered
    *   [ ] First prototype(s) built and tested.
    *   [ ] Full 72-channel system assembled.
    *   [ ] Integration with the CP70 at Paviljoen Ongehoorde Muziek.

## Key Design Aspects (Summary)

*   **Number of Channels:** 72 (one for each pickup)
*   **Input Stage:** High-impedance buffer for each channel.
    *   Target Input Impedance: 470K Î©
    *   Expected Pickup Output: Up to 45V peak-to-peak in 1 M (requiring input attenuation).
*   **Operational Amplifier:** [e.g., TL072 or similar, specify your choice and link to design_decisions.md]
*   **Power Supply:** Symmetrical (e.g., +/-15V or +/-18V)
*   **Gain:** [e.g., Unity gain buffer, or variable gain via potentiometer - specify and link to design_decisions.md]

More detailed information on architecture, component choices, and trade-offs can be found in `/documentation/design_decisions.md`.
